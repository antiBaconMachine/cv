## Profile

Versatile JavaScript specialist with complimentary skills in full stack web
development.

9 years professional experience in a multitude of web and mobile technologies.

I'm looking for a full stack development role where I can focus on delivering great HTML5 apps running on a solid back end.

My background ranges from pure front end HTML5 apps to NodeJs tools to back end web
development with Java, with a detour into mobile and wearables.

In return for a position in an awesome development team, I can bring a multi disciplined
skill set, an approachable demeanour and a focus on writing clean modular,
testable and beautiful code.

## Why Web?

I fell in love with web development when I was ten years old and it still excites me every day.

I enjoy the open experience of developing a web app where there are a multitude of ways to solve every problem.
Compared with native mobile development I find that web apps are typically much more able to carve out their own identity
which is a much more rewarding experience for developers.

One of the most interesting things about being in this field over the last ten years is watching web technology escape the web.
First javascript escaped in NodeJs, opening up the back end and systems programming environments to us. Then web apps
where wrapped as mobile apps providing a real alternative to native stacks. Now the HTML5/CSS/ECMA stack is a viable
implementation choice for all platforms and I couldn't be happier with the incredible pace of progress.

## At a Glance

### Development Experience
* JavaScript expert
* HTML5
* CSS3
* NodeJs
* Cordova mobile apps
* Restful web services
* Java web
* Android native development
* iOS native development (ObjC and Swift)

### Favourite Tools
* git
* Jasmine.js
* gulp
* Jenkins
* Idea
* Linux Mint
* Meteor
* git (Yes, again)

### Modus Operandi

* I prefer to roll frameworks from small tools which do one thing well, over off the shelf monoliths.
* I tend to structure apps using Mediators or Observers, mainly to achieve isolation for testing.
* I think it's more important to have really solid tests for the contract of a module then test every function within it.
* I believe the dev team should drive and constantly reshape their own custom dev process.
