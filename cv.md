## Profile

Versatile JavaScript specialist with complimentary skills in full stack web
development.

9 years professional experience in a multitude of web and mobile technologies.

I'm looking for a full stack development role where I can focus on delivering great HTML5 apps running on a solid back end.

My background ranges from pure front end HTML5 apps to NodeJs tools to back end web
development with Java, with a detour into mobile and wearables.

In return for a position in an awesome development team, I can bring a multi disciplined
skill set, an approachable demeanour and a focus on writing clean modular,
testable and beautiful code.

## Why Web?

I fell in love with web development when I was ten years old and it still excites me every day.

I enjoy the open experience of developing a web app where there are a multitude of ways to solve every problem.
Compared with native mobile development I find that web apps are typically much more able to carve out their own identity
which is a much more rewarding experience for developers.

One of the most interesting things about being in this field over the last ten years is watching web technology escape the web.
NodeJs has opened up the back end and systems programming environments to Javascript. Cordova and it's ilk have provided a real
alternative to native stacks in the mobile space. The HTML5/CSS/ECMA stack is ever more pervasive and I couldn't be
happier with the incredible pace of progress.

<div class="col-md-6 modus">

### Modus Operandi

* I prefer to roll frameworks from small tools which do one thing well, over off the shelf monoliths.
* I tend to structure apps using Mediators or Observers, mainly to achieve isolation for testing.
* I think it's more important to have really solid tests for the contract of a module then test every function within it.
* I believe the dev team should drive and constantly reshape their own custom dev process.

## Experience

#### Senior Developer - Mobbu Ltd

I am responsible for delivering a range of mobile, wearable and web applications. The current focus is on PassWear, an
innovative 2 factor authentication solution utilising a smartwatch as the second factor. I was responsible for design and
implementation of the Android Wear and Tizen web implementations of PassWear and was also heavily involved in the iOS and Android companion apps.
The team is also heavily invested in Cordova based apps which we use to deliver FieldOps, a realtime team communication app.

##### July 2013 - present

#### Senior Web Developer - Codingcraft

I was a senior member of a small contracting team specialising in Java web tech. I was responsible for delivering solutions
across the full web stack directly to clients with a focus on speed of delivery. Clients included Random House,
local government bodies and universities. As a senior member of a small company my role was incredibly varied and involved
a lot of client facing work, guiding customers all the way through the development process from quotation to specification to
implementation to support.

##### August 2011 - June 2013

#### Web Developer - New Era

New Era specialise in a primary education focused e-learning solutions. As
the target audience are very young children it is paramount that simplicity
and usability are prioritised. A key achievement in my time with the
company was the design and implementation of an Erlang
backed real time chat system with a JavaScript front end.

##### February 2009 - August 2011

#### Web and Flash Developer - Bright AI

At the time of my employment this was a young startup agency specialising
in flash and mobile viral marketing games. My key responsibility was
developing flash games for companies such as BSkyB and Walkers.

##### August 2008 - February 2009

#### Web Developer - East Sussex Fire and Rescue

A fantastic job to cut my teeth with at the start of my career, this position
was characterised by intensive learning, primarily in the Java space, with
plenty of mistakes along the way.

##### October 2006 - August 2008

##Education

#### BSc Natural Science: Physics - Open University

The itch I just couldn't scratch, I'm now on the final stretch in my
second degree. I chose physics because it's awesome, and I wanted
something complementary to career without retreading the same ground.
I've found a return to formal mathematical, scientific education has
informed my work and made me more precise and efficient

##### May 2011 - June 2017 (Part time)

#### BA Media Theory and practice (First class) -
University of Sussex

The start of my journey in professional digital media, I studied a wide range
of practical tools, before specialising in Flash development. My resulting final
year project was a sprawling point and click adventure game produced
in Flash for which I received first class honours.

##### September 2002 - May 2005

##And the rest

My hobbies largely involve pizza. After much trial and error I'm happy to report I can now make a pretty mean sourdough.

I play the drums almost well, I play in a couple of local bands.

I ride a rusty bike everywhere, it's the best way to get around Brighton.

If a film/book blurb starts "Set in a post apocalyptic world..." then it's already sold.
