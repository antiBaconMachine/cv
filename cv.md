##And the rest

My hobbies largely involve pizza. After much trial and error I'm happy to report I can now make a pretty mean sourdough. 

I'm a keen cyclist and drummer and an enthusiastic if not polished carpenter.

If a film/book blurb starts "Set in a post apocalyptic world..." then it's already sold.
